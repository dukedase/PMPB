We could make a demand that France cedes their Italian land and Subjects to us, but this is unlikely to succeed, and our nobles will be very upset should we decline to fight France.  However, if we make these demands and fail to back it up with the sword, it could be a disaster..."

We could send an empty threat, but if they decline and we don't back up our words, the Nobles will be enraged."
